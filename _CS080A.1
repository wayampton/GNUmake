I downloaded the repo from GNU and uploaded it right away to
https://github.com/wayampton/GNUmake.git.

Then I discovered that my "autoconf" was old, so I downloaded
the new code from Ubuntu Software Center.

I ran autoconf, then "make update" which created a workable repo.

I then ran "make" to build make. It told me that my "makeinfo"
is missing, but I don't need it. It is just for rebuilding "man"
pages. I might fix it later.

I then ran the make I just built with -v option to get the version
number. Whoops, that didn't work.

I had to update the texinfo package, also from Ubuntu.

Then I was able to rebuild make! and run it.
